CySat-Basestation
=================

This is the repository for the base station software for Iowa State University's CySat project. We aim to build, test, and deploy a working satellite into space, following the [CubeSat] (http://www.cubesat.org/index.php/about-us/mission-statement) specification.

This software will provide functionality for communicating with, controlling, and monitoring the satellite while it is in orbit, as well as tracking and visualizing its passes over the ground.
